Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate 
of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to 
represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. 
Try to compile the code.
