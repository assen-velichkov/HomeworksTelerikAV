C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework.

.NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.

Framework means it contained different applications. Some of the applications are Console Application, Windows Applications, Web Applications. .NET Framework supports more than 20 languages. 

The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language which can run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries. 

C# is the airplane and .NET is the runway.
